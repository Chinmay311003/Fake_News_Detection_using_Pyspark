# Fake_News_Detection_using_Pyspark

In the modern era of digital communication, the prevalence of fake news poses a significant threat to societal trust and the spread of authentic information. Detecting and mitigating the impact of fabricated news articles is a critical challenge for governments, organizations, and individuals alike. This project addresses the issue by leveraging machine learning and data processing techniques to develop a system capable of distinguishing between genuine and fake news.
The dataset used in this project comprises labeled news articles, categorized as either real or fake. The columns include key metadata such as titles, textual content, subjects, and publication dates. PySpark was utilized to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and construct a unified dataset for analysis. Subsequent steps include exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of classification algorithms. This report outlines the methodology employed and evaluates the model's performance in addressing this pressing issue.
